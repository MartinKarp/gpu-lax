// This sample demonstrates three basic usages of multi-device systems.
// Primarily target for these scenarios is a system with multiple
// Intel(R) Xeon Phi(tm) coprocessors, but all information is also applicable
// to any multi-device system (CPU+MIC, CPU+GPU etc.).

// Sample demonstrates minimal sequence of steps to keep all devices busy
// simultaneously. It consists of a simple synthetic kernel operating in 1D
// iteration space, and simple work partitioning strategy -- it just divides
// all work among devices evenly regardless of their compute capabilities.

// The scenarios are:

//    - System-level scenario, with devices mapped to different
//      application instances. Each instance gets its index and knows
//      how many application instances run simultaneously to correctly
//      divide the work and identify the current piece of it.
